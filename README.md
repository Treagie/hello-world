# hello-world
First projects 
Hi, my name is Hannah and I'm a recruiter from Portsmouth (now living in Oxford, working for an office based in London) who is learning to code. My motivations for this were/are to a) understand what I'm recruiting for with a greater depth and be able to speak to developers about their work, and b) to have a project in which I'm learning because I miss learning. I'm learning through FreeCodeCamp and using CodePen for the training projects, as instructed! I'm also blogging about my journey. So far, I've looked at HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap. I'm keen to get stuck into JavaScript now but also a bit afraid...!

I used to be a teacher and only recently (6 months ago) made the switch to recruitment because I wanted a less stressful pace of life. As a result, I like to think I'm not as pushy or aggressive as recruiters seem to have the reputation for being. I'm keen to immerse myself into a new world and coding seems like a fantastic way of doing that. 

I live with my boyfriend and I also enjoy films, cooking, photography, walking and general geeking out.
